1	What do you want?
1	More questions?
1	You'll have more luck asking your questions to someone else. I'm busy.
1	My ^Leige^?
EOD
-1	20000	2	2	BYE*GOOD-BYE*GOODBYE*OVER OUT*10-4
2	Later on.
2	Ciao.
2	It's about time...
2	Peace.
EOD
-1	-1	1	3	HELP*ADVICE
3	We all feel helpless at times.
3	Feeling helpless?
EOD
10	-1	1	90	HELP*ADVICE
90	We need to send probes to investigate the wreckage. Talk to @3 for more details.
EOD
12	-1	1	68	HELP*ADVICE
68	We need to spend time building weapons and shielding. That wreck is ample evidence that hostile beings exist in this region of the galaxy.
EOD
11	-1	1	92	HELP*ADVICE
92	We should travel to the nearby star that we found marked in the data bouy we found from the wreckage.
EOD
9	-1	1	5	VOID DWELLERS
5	I don't understand the childlike fascination the rest of the crew has for these creatures. Clouds of gas... Simple and uninteresting. Hmrph.
EOD
1	-1	1	6	D'PAHK WORMS
6	They certainly aren't pretty. I do, however, find them amusing and from their transmissions I think they are agreeable enough. I don't think we have a reason to doubt them.
EOD
0	-1	1	7	SENGZHAC*BUGS*BUGGERS
7	Wretched creatures. Conjure visions of demons... At least that's what I see when I see them. Vile!
EOD
12	-1	1	67	SENGZHAC
67	My reading from the second buoy is that they were being chased quite doggedly by these Sengzhac.
EOD
8	-1	1	8	GUILD TRADERS
8	I have to wonder how a race could evolve as arbiters on a stellar level. They must have achieved space travel relatively early by galactic standards. It would be interesting to see what the void dwellers have to say about them.
EOD
40	-1	1	9	PHAEDOR MOCH*PUPPET MASTERS
9	I won't begin to pretend that I understand them. It's my opinion that the cypher key that they sent us was scrambled. How else could the computer translate their message into such meaningless rambling?
EOD
3	-1	3	10	ERMIGEN
10	Despite the shielding array that they had I was able to make some sense of their hardware and ship configurations. They possess shield technology on a level i've never seen. They seem to be utilizing masking pods to generate some kind of
10	wave cascade that renders their flagships almost invulnerable to any of our weaponry. I will have to study them in depth.
EOD
5	-1	3	11	QUAI PA'LOI*PAI ALOI*Q'OOUL
11	@3 seems to think there is some divine reason that we have encountered a race that gives the number four significance as opposed to the human trinity. The science officer seems has reason to suspect that it may have to do with
11	the carbon links in organic chemistry. As you well know, carbon has four electron bond sights. @3 says they spoke with their science officer during our first encounter. I've read the log of their conversation. What I've read
11	of it suggests that some ancient link, be it social or genetic, exists between the guild and the Quai Pa'loi. I may be jumping to conclusions, but it's my guess that the Guild shaped the religions of infant races to suit its own ends.
11	of which the Quai Pa'loi was one.
EOD
7	502	1	14	ICON
14	A very advanced race to have never developed a spoken language.
EOD
4	-1	1	15	TITARIAN
15	As you may already know psychometry has discovered startling things about the Titerian.
EOD
15	-1	2	16	YLINTHLIXYMN*YLINTH
16	What did you call me?
16	Bless you.
16	Huh?
16	Oh, them. It must pain the guild greatly to know that they were responsible for the total destruction of a race.
EOD
6	-1	1	17	SCAVENGERS*SCAVENGER*ASSEMBLER*ASSEMBLERS*SCAVS
17	Their make up is a great deal like the Titerians. However, they lack the Titerian temporal shift ability. They seem to be motivated to assimilate foreign organic and synthetic matter into their collective.
EOD
2	-1	1	18	AARD
18	I would like to get my hands on the genome data from their makeup. Oh, the things i could do with that kind of information. The tech that i could design, the... Well, Laird, you get the picture. See what you can do about getting me a better scan.
EOD
-1	-1	3	23	TROJAN GATE*GATES
23	@3 briefed me on the topic. Intriguing. I'm doing research when I can during down time. I still don't know enough about the subject to be of help... I would appreciate it if you would tell me if we make any related discoveries.
EOD
-1	-1	3	24	MONKS*MONK
24	Reminiscent of the greek gods. From what i can gather they have a cult-like following which is not exclusive to any particular race. Small sects from nearly every race we have encountered ^seem^ to have some knowledge of this peculiar group. The
24	most startling thing about them is that they may be humanoids.
EOD
-1	-1	1	25	HOMEWORLD*FLESH
25	I, for one, do not miss the confining ^flesh^ of our home. I find the immortality of the ^encode^ a liberating concept.
EOD
-1	-1	1	26	SELL*BUY*TRADE
26	Anything that I have is yours, Laird. we have nothing to exchange of worth except ideas and those I give to you freely.
EOD
-1	-1	1	27	HALLIFAX MANEUVER
27	What kind of sociopolitical evolution would the Hallifaxine have to undergo to be motivated to destroy each other for purely religious reasons? Reminds me of... the legends. Of the time before the flight of the ^albatross^.
EOD
-1	-1	3	28	NOVA
28	A super nova is the final explosive stage in a star's evolution. The stellar furnace that fuses nucleic material begins in the heart of an infant sun by melding hydrogen into helium. This process continues to create heavier elements until,
28	At last, ^iron^ begins to form at the heart of the star. ^Iron^ is so stable that no amount of compression or nuclear heat is sufficient to fuse it. When enough iron has been formed the sheer weight of it is enough to cause it to fall toward
28	the star's core. Because the iron will not fuse the collapse results in an inevitable breakpoint at which it can no longer collapse. The shock wave that results is enough to blow off nearly all of the star's surface material. Enough energy
28	is given off to provide the luminescence of an entire galaxy. A rather spectacular but destructive display.
EOD
-1	-1	3	29	SHUNT
29	More, better, and faster... The shunt drive is all of these.
EOD
-1	-1	1	30	PHASE
30	This is an alternative view of instantaneous travel which utilizes psychic technologies rather than conventional physics. The basic concept involves nullifying the space the target mass
30	to the target location.
EOD
-1	-1	1	31	GOD'S EYE*GODS EYE
31	They say that our paradise is on the other side of God's Eye. How can the D'pahk be so sure? I wish it might be true.
EOD
-1	-1	1	32	IRONSEED
32	That is the name of this ^vessel^ as well as the name of the ^movement^ which allowed us to escape the Sol system.
EOD
18	-1	1	33	THERMOPLAST
33	Useful stuff. I've kept @2 busy with questions on the subject. I hope to use the material on the hull of the ship to increase shielding values.
EOD
-1	-1	1	36	LAIRD*LEIGE*LORD
36	That is your title, my Lord.
EOD
-1	-1	1	37	ALBATROSS*BIRD
37	The blue ^albatross^ is the ^symbol^ of ^birth^. the ^martyrs^ of the Purgation ^Trials^ took on the symbol as their own. As a result the members of the ironseed movement continued and uplifted its use. It is now a holy symbol.
EOD
-1	-1	3	38	PURGATION*TRIAL*TRIALS
38	During the previous century ^synths^ and ^constructs^ finally replaced humans beings as the work force. The ruling class treated the synths like slaves and rationalized such cruel behavior by saying that the synths had no souls.
38	In order to eliminate opposition to this obviously despotic view the ruling class staged a series of "incidents" which ruined the position of the synth-sympathizers. They were branded as dangerous and subsequently tried and jailed en mass.
EOD
-1	-1	1	39	MARTYRS*MARTYR
39	These were the brave souls who had all of their ^personality^ code erased scrambled or recompiled.
EOD
-1	-1	1	40	SYMBOL*BIRTH
40	^Legend^ has it that the first ^drop colony^ ship was called the albatross. Life, the spirit, it comes from water. Since both the albatross and water were life bringers the two were eventually made synonymous in theological terms.
EOD
-1	-1	3	41	SYNTHS*SYNTH*CONSTRUCT*CONSTRUCTS 
41	Synth is a contraction of the term synthetic, more appropriately, synthetic organism. Constructs, as they are also called, were originally created by the ttek priests for mindless tasks.
41	Gradually as they were used for more complex tasks they were designed with more and more sophisticated personalities. Eventually they were capable of self awareness and the inevitable question was asked, "Are they alive?"
41	The ruling class suppressed such politically damaging questions with their answer, on the basis that nothing man-made can be infused with life. Constructs had no souls.
EOD
-1	-1	1	42	DROP*COLONY*LEGEND
42	Drop ships were the colony ships used during the ^exodus^. When the ^old world^ passed away, they took us from its rotting bosom and we flew to the red world, Mars.
EOD
-1	-1	3	43	EXODUS*OLD WORLD*THIRD PLANET*THIRD WORLD*HOMEWORLD
43	Almost two thousand years ago humankind was judged. The righteous were taken on the wings of the albatross to the red world. The third world is now a dead stone in space, lifeless. We speak of it only in hushed tones.
43	Its name is the name of iniquity, to speak it is to speak blasphemy.
EOD
-1	-1	1	44	EARTH
44	Hold your tongue! Such things are forbidden. That is the name of iniquity. Do not speak it again unless you wish to incur the ^wrath^ of the ^almighty^.
EOD
1	-1	1	45	JAMMING*SHIELD*READING
45	Have you been speaking with @1. Unfounded ranting is what I say. Psychic shielding... Hrmph!
EOD
-1	-1	1	46	JOB*SECURITY*PURPOSE
46	As if you have forgotten... I am chief security officer, @4, for the ironseed, and it is my job to protect this vessel and its crew from all threats, external or internal.
EOD
-1	-1	3	47	IRON*SHIP*TRAVEL
47	We are currently aboard and apart of an exploration vessel.
47	As chief officers of this ship it was made our duty to safely deliver those of the ironseed ^movement^ safely to a habitable world... That we might ^seed^ it with liberal minds.
EOD
-1	-1	1	48	SEED
48	We had no choice but to flee Mars and the Sol system. We could not allow ourselves and our thoughts to be controlled. Such a puppet existence would be intolerable.
EOD
-1	-1	1	49	TITLE
49	As Laird, Lord and Archon of this ship you are the prime encode.

EOD
-1	-1	1	56	SOUL*SOULS
56	Souls... ephemeral concept. perhaps they do exist... But what will that change if they do?
EOD
-1	-1	1	57	INCIDENT*INCIDENTS
57	Many terrible things were done to give cause for imprisoning ^sympathizers^.
EOD
-1	-1	2	58	SYMPATHIZERS*SYMPATHIZER*TRIED*CONVICTED*JAILED
58	We were the ones who were believed to wish that constructs were free...
58	It is ironic that many of those imprisoned weren't part of the ironseed movement. The ^Purgation Trials^ were a convenient way for many to rid themselves of political enemies...
EOD
-1	-1	1	59	TTEK PRIESTS*CLERGY*PRIEST
59	Tools... They were tools of god. At least that is what they told themselves. @1 can tell you all about it.
EOD
-1	-1	1	60	RELIGION
60	Religion is an opiate. It only serves to pacify the ignorant.
EOD
-1	-1	1	61	BLASPHEMY

62	I pray...
62	I pray that one day i will understand my ^ignorance^.
EOD
-1	-1	1	63	IGNORANCE
63	The first thing to being wise is to know you know nothing. Godliness is to know why you know nothing.

90	My reading from the second buoy is that they were being chased quite doggedly by these Sengzhac.

91	It was attacked, that much is evident.
