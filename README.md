# Ironseed-py
Iron Seed is a science-fiction DOS game from 1994, which was both developed and published by Channel 7.  Gameplay is real-time, featuring trading, diplomacy, and strategy.  This repository contains a very in-development Python version of the game engine.  Note: This is unplayable at the moment, but you can see some experiments I am running with the intro.
